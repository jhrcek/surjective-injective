# Surjective / Injective

Visual exploration of surjectivity and injectivity (as a properties of mathematical functions).

Live [demo](https://janhrcek.cz/surjective-injective).

## TODO

-   function diagram
    -   Add A, B as set labels
-   controls for generating random functions
    -   generate any function
    -   surjective, injective (only enabled when such a function exists for given domain/codomain size)
-   add explanation about why given function is NOT surjective / injective
-   don't show generate button when there are no functions / just one function for given domain/codomain size
